# California Reservoirs Data & Car Sounds Dashboard

This project is a full-stack dashboard application that combines California reservoir data analysis with car sound anomaly detection. The purpose of the project is to help government and automotive organizations monitor environmental and mechanical conditions more effectively using data-driven insights.

## Reservoirs Dashboard

The Reservoirs Dashboard focuses on visualizing water level trends, inflow/outflow patterns, and supporting decision-making through interactive graphs and charts. It allows users to explore time-series data and understand the current status of California's reservoirs in an intuitive manner.

## Car Sounds Analyzer

The Car Sounds Analyzer uses machine learning to process uploaded vehicle sound files and detect anomalies that may indicate engine issues. It applies signal processing techniques and trained models to classify sounds and provide diagnostic feedback, helping identify problems like engine misfires or unusual mechanical behavior.

## Technology Stack

The application is built using:

- **React** for the frontend UI
- **FastAPI** for building scalable backend APIs
- **Python** with libraries such as **scikit-learn**, **Librosa**, and **SoundFile** for audio analysis and machine learning

This project demonstrates the integration of data science, web development, and cloud-ready APIs in a unified, user-friendly platform.
